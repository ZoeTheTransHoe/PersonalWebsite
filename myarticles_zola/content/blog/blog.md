Hi! This is my first blog post I will ever write on this god forsaken website. 

Im using a SSG (Static Site Generator, basically a really fancy way to make websites quickly using templates and markdown files instead of pure, antagonising CSS/HTML.) called Zola to make these blogs. Pretty cool! Hopefully I have a lot to share here soon.

For the time being, heres a simple blog from me to get the ball rolling. 

It is no secret I am a fan of the Linux Desktops we have - and especially GNOME and KDE. However, while people poise them as diametrically opposite, and people often divinding themselves into Gnomies or Plasmoids, and will die on their hill that their DE is better, I see good in both. So here are 5 things from both that I like and enjoy from both.

5 reasons I love KDE Plasma 
<ol>
    <li>Gaming Features Make Their Way First To Plasma </li>
    <li>Endless Customizability While Remaining Approachable </li>
    <li>Discover > Gnome Software IMHO </li>
    <li>Flatpak Management In Settings </li>
    <li>Konqi :3333 </li>
</ol>

5 reasons I love GNOME
<ol>
    <li>Stable To A Fault </li>
    <li>The Workflow and Touchpad Support Is Ingenious </li>
    <li>Network Shares / Storage Managment Is Much Less Pain On GNOME. </li>
    <li>Incredible App Ecosystem </li> 
    <li>Best OOTB Experience Of Any Desktop On Linux </li>
</ol>
Overall, Both desktops are incredible achievements for FOSS, and should both be celebrated and critisied in their own right, without unfairly putting one down or writing one off completely.
